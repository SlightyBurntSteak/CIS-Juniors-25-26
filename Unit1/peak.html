        <p>Peak is a Multiplayer Co-op Game all about scouts climbing to the top of a mountian.<br>
        I first started this game in July of 2025, around 2 months after it first released.<br>
        I was introduced to it by friends when we were bored one day, I saw gameplay of them playing it and wanted to join in.<br>
        So I went and got it on steam and joined my friends lobby to have fun together.</p>

        <p>After I got the game we started, we got half way through to the game to an area called the Alpines before we died.<br>
        So we continued and continued and so on and so forth. About a week later me and my friend (who we will call Cake) pushed through and made it to the peak of the mountian. With my other friend (who will be call Egg) who already made it to the peak a day before us.<br>
        My and my other friends mission is to help my last friend (which we will call Icecream) make it to the top of the mountian aswell.<br>
        After a few weeks of on and off playing and a huge update later, we perserved and Icecream made it to the peak with us. Now we just challenge ourselves with mods and other things as we wait for the next big update.</p>
